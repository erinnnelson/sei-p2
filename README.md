# Project Overview

This is Student Coding Project 2, created by Erinn Nelson, for the NYC General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Panda Cohort.

## Project Description

The purpose of the app is to build music playlists for running. Users may search for and receive information about songs through use of the [GetSongBPM API](https://getsongbpm.com/api). The user may add songs from their serarches to a playlist and sort them by tempo.

Created using React.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

**MVP**

*App can successfully call API for song info based on title

*Results from search can be rendered on page as song cards

*User may choose song cards to add to a playlist

*User may remove songs from playlist

**PostMVP**

*Playlists can be sorted manually or by BPM

*Song cards in playlists can be expanded for more info

*Playlists can be saved and stored to local storage 

*List informtion about running and pace

## React Component Hierarchy

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

## Functional Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 

<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs | -->

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

<!-- ## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object -->
